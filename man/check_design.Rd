\title{Validates the specified design}
\usage{
check_design(within = list(), between = list(), n = 100, mu = 0,
  sd = 1, r = 0, dv = list(y = "Score"), id = list(id =
  "Subject ID"), plot = TRUE, design = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{within}{a list of the within-subject factors}

\item{between}{a list of the between-subject factors}

\item{n}{the number of samples required}

\item{mu}{a vector giving the means of the variables}

\item{sd}{the standard deviations of the variables}

\item{r}{the correlations among the variables (can be a single number, vars\*vars matrix, vars\*vars vector, or a vars\*(vars-1)/2 vector)}

\item{dv}{the name of the DV column list(y = "Score")}

\item{id}{the name of the ID column list(id = "Subject ID")}

\item{plot}{whether to show a plot of the design}

\item{design}{a design list including within, between, n, mu, sd, r, dv, id}
}
\value{
list
}
\description{
Specify any number of within- and between-subject factors with any number of 
levels. Specify n for each between-subject cell; mu and sd for each cell, and
r for the within-subject cells for each between-subject cell.
}
\details{
This function returns a validated design list for use in sim_design_ to 
simulate a data table with this design, or to archive your design.

\examples{

within <- list(time = c("day", "night"))
between <- list(pet = c("dog", "cat"))
mu <- list(dog = 10, cat = 5)

between <- list(language = c("dutch", "thai"),
                pet = c("dog", "cat"))
mu <- list(dutch_dog = 12, thai_dog = 8, dutch_cat = 7, thai_cat = 3)
check_design(within, between, mu = mu)
