\title{Treatment code a factor}
\usage{
treatment_code(fct, levels = NULL, base = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fct}{the factor to contrast code (or a vector)}

\item{levels}{the levels of the factor in order}

\item{base}{the index of the level to use as baseline}
}
\value{
the factor with contrasts set
}
\description{
Treatment coding sets the mean of the reference group as the intercept. 
Each contrast compares one level with the reference level (base).
