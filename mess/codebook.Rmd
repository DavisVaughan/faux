The `codebook()` function creates a [PyschDS]()-formatted codebook from your data.

```{r}
between <- list(
  pet = c(cat = "Has a cat", dog = "Has a dog")
)
within <- list(
  time = c("day", "night")
)
df <- sim_design(within, between, 
                 mu = 1:4, sd = 1,
                 dv = "score", 
                 long = TRUE)
```

Just running `codebook(df)` gives you a basic codebook generated from the data in your data frame.

```{r}
codebook(df)
```

If you want to give more into about the columns, describe the columns using a named vector.

```{r}

coldesc <- c(id = "Participant ID",
             pet = "Kind of pet this participant has", 
             time = "Time of day tested",
             score = "Score on a happiness questionnaire")

codebook(df, coldesc)
```

If you set `interactive = TRUE` and run the command in the console (not in an Rmd script), you will be prompted to name each column and factor level.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cb <- codebook(df, interactive = TRUE)
```
