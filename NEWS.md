# faux 0.0.0.9004

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added `sim_design()` to simulate data for mixed ANOVA designs.

# faux 0.0.0.9005

* Bug fixes for `sim_design()` (failed when within or between factor number was 0)

# faux 0.0.0.9006

* Changes to argument order and names (more consistent, but may break old scripts)
* Updated vignettes

# faux 0.0.0.9007

* Added a plot option to `check_design()` and `sim_design()`
* Design lists returned by `check_design()` have a more consistent format 
    - n, mu, and sd are all data frames with between-cells as rows and within-cells as columns
    - `within` and `between` are named lists; factors and labels are no longer separately named
    
# faux 0.0.0.9008

* added `sim_mixed_cc()` to simulate null cross-classified mixed effect designs by subject, item and error SDs
* `sim_design()`, `sim_df()`, `sim_mixed_cc()` and `sim_mixed_df()` take a `seed` argument now for reproducible datasets

# faux 0.0.0.9009

* Bug fix for `long2wide()` (handle designs with no between or no within factors)
* `sim_df()` returns subject IDs and takes data in long format
* Renamed `check_sim_stats()` to `get_params()`, which now returns the design
* Added interactive option to `sim_design()`

# faux 0.0.0.9010

* Fixed bugs in interactive specification
* Added `messy()` (thanks Emily)
* Better interactive specification (thanks DaniÃ«l)

# faux 0.0.0.9011

* Changed default DV column name from 'val' to 'y'
* Changed default ID column name from 'sub_id' to 'id'
* `sim_design()` can take intercept-only designs
* `rnorm_multi()` can take vars = 1 for intercept-only designs
* `json_design()` to output or save design specs in JSON format
* Added functions for converting between distributions
* More flexible plots
